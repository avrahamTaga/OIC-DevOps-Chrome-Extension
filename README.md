Chrome Extension for Exporting OIC Integrations and Uploading to GitHub.
This Chrome extension allows users to export integrations from Oracle Integration Cloud (OIC) and upload them to a GitHub repository. The extension makes API calls to IDCS (Oracle Identity Cloud Service) and OIC (Oracle Integration Cloud) to authenticate and retrieve the Integration file, and then uses the GitHub API to upload the integration file.

Features
Export OIC integrations: Users can select an integration from their OIC instance and export it as a file.
Authentication with IDCS: The extension makes an API call to IDCS to obtain an authentication token, which is required to access the OIC APIs.
GitHub integration: After exporting the integration, the extension makes an API call to GitHub to upload the integration file to a specific repository.

Prerequisites
Before using the extension, ensure you have the following:

Google Chrome browser installed on your computer.
An active OIC instance with integrations that you want to export.
Access to an Oracle IDCS account with the necessary permissions to authenticate and retrieve data from OIC.
A GitHub account and a repository where you want to upload the integration files.

Installation
To install the Chrome extension, follow these steps:

Download the extension package from the GitHub repository.
Extract the downloaded package to a local directory on your computer.
Open Google Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions.
Enable the "Developer mode" toggle switch in the top right corner of the page.
Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the directory where you extracted the extension package.
The extension should now be installed and visible in your Chrome browser.

Configuration
Before using the extension, you need to configure it with the necessary information. Follow these steps to configure the extension:

Click on the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar to open the extension popup.
Click on the "Settings" button to open the configuration page.
Provide the required information in the configuration fields:
OIC Base URL: The base URL of your OIC instance (e.g., https://my-oic-instance.oraclecloud.com).
IDCS Base URL: The base URL of your IDCS instance (e.g., https://my-idcs-instance.identity.oraclecloud.com).
IDCS Client ID: The client ID for your IDCS application.
IDCS Client Secret: The client secret for your IDCS application.
GitHub Token: An access token generated from your GitHub account with write access to the repository.
GitHub Repository: The repository where you want to upload the integration files (e.g., your-username/your-repo).
Click the "Save" button to store the configuration.
The extension is now configured and ready to use.

Exporting Integrations
To export an integration from OIC and upload it to GitHub, follow these steps:

Open the OIC console and navigate to the integrations page.
Select the integration you want to export.
Click on the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar to open the extension popup.
Click the "Export" button.
Wait for the export process to complete. The extension will generate a file with the integration definition.
Once the export is finished, the extension will automatically upload the file to the specified GitHub repository.
You can monitor the progress and see the status of the export and upload processes in the extension popup.

Limitations
The extension currently supports exporting and uploading one integration at a time.
The exported integration file will be in a specific format compatible with OIC. Make sure you have the necessary tools and knowledge to work with OIC integration files.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while using the extension, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

Ensure that you have provided the correct configuration details in the extension settings.
Check your internet connection to ensure that you can access OIC, IDCS, and GitHub.
Verify that the selected integration in OIC is valid and does not have any errors or dependencies that may affect the export process.
Make sure you have the necessary permissions and access rights in OIC, IDCS, and GitHub to perform the required actions.
Check the extension popup for any error messages or status updates that may provide insights into the issue.
If the problem persists, try restarting the extension or reloading the OIC console.
If none of the above steps resolve the problem, consider reaching out to the extension developer or referring to the documentation for further assistance.

Security Considerations
When using the Chrome extension, it is important to keep the following security considerations in mind:

Protect your IDCS Client ID and Client Secret: Ensure that these credentials are kept confidential and not shared with unauthorized individuals.
Secure your GitHub Token: Treat the GitHub access token as sensitive information and store it securely. Be cautious not to expose the token in public repositories or insecure environments.
Validate the extension source: Before installing the extension, verify that it comes from a trusted source to minimize the risk of malicious code execution.
